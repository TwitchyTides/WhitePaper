# Twitch Game

The Twitch integration is a core feature of Twitchy Tides, allowing players to interact with their fish during live streams.

### How it Works:

1. Players register their fish on the Twitchy Tides website
2. During a Twitch stream, players can use chat commands to control their fish
3. Fish appear in the streamer's overlay, creating an interactive aquarium experience

### Twitch Commands:

* Use in-game abilities like !up, !down, !left, !right, !spin, !freeze, and !fart
* Interact with other players' fish and stream elements
