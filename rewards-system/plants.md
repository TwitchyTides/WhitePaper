# ðŸŒ± Plants

Plants are decorative and functional items in Twitchy Tides tanks.

### Plant Functions:

1. **Food generation**: All plants generate food (production according to rarity) every 2 days
2. **Decoration**: Enhance the visual appeal of tanks

### Plant Acquisition:

1. **Shop Purchases**: Available for purchase with $TIDE tokens
2. **Blends**: Plants can be blended to combine 2 of the same rarity, to get a plant of next rarity.

### Plant Rarity:

Like fish, plants may come in different rarities, each offering unique benefits or visual effects.
